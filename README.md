Decline curve analysis examines the relationship between the oil flow rate and time for wells in production.
Decline curves can follow Exponential, Hyperbolic, or Harmonic patterns.
A line was fitted to the production data, with the assumption that the identified trend will persist in the future.
Flow rate and time data were analyzed by fitting predefined models using the SciPy library in Python.
